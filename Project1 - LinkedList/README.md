# Project1
Task: designing a new data structure to hold relation of student names with their scores, which are saved in two independent linked lists.

Solution: implementing a two dimensional array to hold indexes of each nodes of the linked lists.

## Notice:
- not the most efficient algorithm
- consider existence of possible bugs
- (development put on hold)
